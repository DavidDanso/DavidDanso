# Hi, I'm David 👋

**Python Developer** transitioning into **LLM App Development** — passionate about building AI tools that help fintech and compliance teams work more efficiently and make better decisions.

I’m currently strengthening my foundation in:
- LLM frameworks like LangChain and vector search technology
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) fundamentals
- Cloud deployment and scaling with AWS

### 🎯 My Mission
Use AI to automate slow, manual, high-stakes workflows such as:
- Reviewing compliance policies
- Extracting insights from regulatory documents
- Detecting fraud and risky activities early

I want my work to **reduce repetitive tasks** and **increase trust + accuracy** in financial systems.

### 🧱 What I'm Building Right Now
Learning by shipping practical real-world apps:
- **Compliance Document Q&A** — RAG app for policy lookup
- **Research Assistant** — Summarize, compare, and extract insights across multiple files
- **Fraud Risk Categorizer** — Helps streamline risk review workflows

These projects help me grow from fundamentals → production readiness.

📌 Always learning. Always building.
